Our team has decided to use mysql, because it is the database we are most comfortable with given the lab and HW we've done.
At the moment we have 4 tables: CustEvent, Customer, Event, and EventType.
Each table contains 5 rows.
CustEvent is the table which connects the rest of the tables and contains all of our primary keys.
Customer contains all the user info
Event contains all the info about an event
EventType contains the info about what type of event it is i.e. music, school,etc...
