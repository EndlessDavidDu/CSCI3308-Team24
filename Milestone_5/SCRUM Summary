     This SCRUM went better then our previous stand up meetings. We were a lot quicker in going around the team and our focus was a lot better. For this SCRUM we made sure that we had our Sprint Planning right before. This allowed us to easily know what we were going to work on so there wasn't any confusion as we had the meeting. 
     Our website can be split up into two primary sections, the web page and the database. For this two week sprint we wanted to put everybody on working on the website and the front-end portion of the project. This meant that David D. and Tom were going to focus on the login and register page and getting it to talk to the database. Their goal was not only to build a simple page but to build in intelligence that scrambles the user password and remembers when a user has registered. David I., Subi, and Ice were going to focus on the event page and the home page with the carousels. Subi's main focus was to build the framework for the website, David I. worked on how to build the layered carousels, and Ice focused on the design and color palette. This break down allowed us all to work in our own territory but also forced us to work as a team since we all relied on one another to complete their part. 
     Briefly we focused on what we completed the previous sprint and unfortunently we didn't accomplish as much as we had hoped. A lot of members spent a majority of their time learning the material needed to build this project, the html, css, javascript, and sql. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, we underestimated the learning curve going into sprint one so for sprint two we had to push even harder to make up ground.
