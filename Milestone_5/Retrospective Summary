    In this meeting we have discussed the whole progress of the project. We have summarized the things need to do keep up, 

stop and things we need to start thinking(working). 
    
    One of the most important things we need to start is communication. This involves talking about the progress of work we 

have done and also the work load. We need to check the work progress much frequently. We have also considered the collaboration 

of work. For example, we need to start doing some pair-programming task and share work we have done during the progress. 

This could help us to improve the work efficiency. 

    We need to avoid hoarding a huge amount of work until the last minute. We have used Trello to manage our task we have done. 

Also keep away from working alone. If we have problem, just ask each other. 

    There are so many things we need to keep it up. We often have a lot of work need to be done for other course. Therefore, 

think about the realistic workload. If we could not be able to finish the assigned task, talk with other people to help with 

it. In order to complete each milestone on time, we often need to set up the timeline for each task to keep track of it. In 

Trello. We often use it to break down and assigned task to each other in this software, as well as setting up the timeline 

for work. We often use Slack to do the general conversation. Sometimes we use skype to do with small-group meeting while 

doing assigned task.
