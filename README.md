Description: An app and website which allows you to organize all of your planned events in one space, conveniently and cleanly. Rendezvous integrates with other websites and allows users to quickly find events that interest them. They are able to do search quickly through categories we've predefined (sports, music, etc) as well as search for an event by name or location if they want to be more specific. When a user plans an event, the event is easily displayed in the app and website through a few customizable display options (calendar, list, etc). By allowing the user to play with notification settings Rendezvous will always remind the user that their event is approaching. Finally, Rendezvous allows friends to view, share, and discuss the events they are interested in.

While there are many other scheduler and planning apps avalilable, Rendezvous is unique because it combines finding event information, planning events, and having a social experience all-in-one. Many sites specialize in only one part of this scheduling process but Rendezvous allows everything to occur quickly and simulatenously. By creating both an app and a website Rendezvous allows users to accomplish all of this on the go and at home so that they will never miss an important event.  
      
Vision Statement: Easily create, manage, and share all of your events in one space. 

Motivation: There are applications and websites out there that allow for event planning but none sync together, e.g Facebook events do not sync to my Apple Calendar. This is going to help those who already enjoy maintaining a schedule and are organized, as well as those who want to. Currently, there is not an effective method to notify users about the events they RSVP'ed to. There needs to be an event managing/planning application that joins all of your events together in one place and helps to remind and keep you updated about the events you are choosing to attend. 

Risks:
-Working environment: We won't always be working on the project together in the same place. We are not familiar with one another's worth ethic and we need to learn how we work best with one another (who fits best into which role).
-Lack of experience: None of us have made a phone application before so achieving the mobile app may be an obstacle the group will have to overcome. Also, none of us are familiar with the programming languages used to develop mobile applications. There are some in the group who have experience with web development but not the entire group. Some of us may have to play "catch up".


Risk Mitigation Plan:	We can plan meetings and work times that way the group can work collaboratively in the same space. This will make it easy for all of us to communicate with one another in an easy and time effective way. Furthermore, we can all use various resources such as the Internet, books, other people, tutorials and more to make up for the lack of experience we have in app development. We can also communicate our strengths and weaknesses to each other and assign tasks accordingly. For the sake of time and lack of experience we can also focus on one platform for the app. 

Version Control: GitHub

Software Development Methodology: Agile - Software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles. You are continuously planning what you need to get done and things can happen simultaneously. We use agile when the requirements aren't initially known, when technology is not well understood, and when product definition is unstable or changing. 

Collaboration Tool: Slack
