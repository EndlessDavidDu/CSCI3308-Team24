# CSCI3308-Team24

Members: Aycel Villalobos, Subi Nair, Tom Eldar, David Ingragam, David Du, Patrick Hemmer

Description: 

Motivation: There are applications and websites out there that allow for event planning but none sync together, e.g Facebook events do not sync to my Apple Calendar. This is going to help those who already enjoy maintaing schedule and are organized, as well as those who want to. Currently, there is not an effective method to nofiy users about the events the RSVP'ed to. There needs to be an event managing/planning application that joins all of your events together in one place and helps to remind and keep you updated about the events you are choosing to attend. 

Risks:
-Working environment: We won't always be working on the project together in the same place. We are not familiar with one anohter's worth ethic and we need to learn how we work best with one another (who fits best into which roll).
-Lack of experience: None of us have made a phone application before so achieving the mobile app may be an obstacle the group will have to overcome. Also, none of us are familiar with the programming languages used to develop mobile applications. There are some in the group who have experience with web development but not the entire group. Some of us may have to play "catch up:.
